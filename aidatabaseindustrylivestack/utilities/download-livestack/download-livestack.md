# Download the LiveStack

## Introduction

This lab shows how to run the Energy and Utilities Grid Operations LiveStack in your own environment using the portable stack package and Podman Compose. The local stack starts the database, ORDS, Ollama, and web application services so you can replay the same utility operations demo outside the hosted environment.

Estimated Time: 30 minutes

### Objectives

In this lab, you will:
- Download the portable Energy and Utilities LiveStack package.
- Extract the package into a clean working directory.
- Prepare the runtime environment file.
- Start the full application stack with Podman Compose.
- Validate the application health endpoint and open the UI.
- Stop the stack cleanly after the demo.

## Task 1: Download the portable package

1. Download the package named `livestack-utilities.zip` from the provided LiveStack distribution location.
2. Save the file to your machine.

The package contains the Energy and Utilities LiveStack application, compose configuration, database initialization assets, and supporting runtime files needed to run the demo locally.

## Task 2: Prepare the working directory

Do not extract or run the stack from your `Downloads` folder. Create a new working directory and move `livestack-utilities.zip` there first.

### For macOS or Linux

1. Open a terminal.

2. Create a new working directory outside of `Downloads`:
    ```bash
    <copy>
    mkdir -p ~/livestack-utilities-demo
    </copy>
    ```

3. Move into the new working directory:
    ```bash
    <copy>
    cd ~/livestack-utilities-demo
    </copy>
    ```

4. Move the downloaded package from `Downloads` into this directory:
    ```bash
    <copy>
    mv ~/Downloads/livestack-utilities.zip .
    </copy>
    ```

5. Extract the package:
    ```bash
    <copy>
    unzip livestack-utilities.zip
    </copy>
    ```

6. Move into the extracted folder:
    ```bash
    <copy>
    cd utilities
    </copy>
    ```

7. Create your runtime environment file:
    ```bash
    <copy>
    cp .env.example .env
    </copy>
    ```

Confirm that the folder contains `compose.yml` or `compose.yaml`, `.env`, and the required application files.

## Task 3: Start the demo with Podman Compose

1. Start the stack:
    ```bash
    <copy>
    podman compose up -d --build
    </copy>
    ```

2. Check container status:
    ```bash
    <copy>
    podman compose ps
    </copy>
    ```

3. Validate application health:
    ```bash
    <copy>
    curl http://localhost:8505/api/health
    </copy>
    ```

4. Verify Select AI and runtime health:
    ```bash
    <copy>
    curl http://localhost:8505/api/selectai/health
    </copy>
    ```

5. Open the demo in a browser:
    ```text
    http://localhost:8505
    ```

The UI should load as **Seer Utility Network LiveStack**. The sidebar should show the Energy and Utilities scenes, the active dataset should show demo data, and the Ask Utility Data page should report the configured runtime profile.

## Task 4: Stop the stack when finished

1. Stop and remove the running containers:
    ```bash
    <copy>
    podman compose down
    </copy>
    ```

The local LiveStack is stopped cleanly.

## Task 5: Why this matters?

1. Use the download lab to turn the guide into a repeatable field asset.
2. Confirm that every presenter can use the same archive name, extracted layout, app URL, health routes, startup command, and clean shutdown command.
3. Restore or reset the demo dataset from the application if you need to return the local environment to a known baseline after a custom utility-data walkthrough.
