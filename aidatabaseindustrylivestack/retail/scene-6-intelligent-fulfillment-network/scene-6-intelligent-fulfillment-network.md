# Scene 6 Intelligent Fulfillment Network

## Introduction

**Intelligent Fulfillment Network** helps the retailer decide how to serve demand from the right location. The page connects customer demand, fulfillment-center coverage, inventory levels, route distance, and operational load so teams can balance cost, speed, capacity, and customer experience.

Retail teams struggle when this information lives in separate tools. That separation makes it harder to act quickly and trust the result.

Oracle AI Database helps address these challenges by keeping spatial, relational, inventory, shipment, demand forecast, and security-governed data together. Oracle Spatial stores fulfillment centers, service zones, customers, and demand regions as `SDO_GEOMETRY`. SQL can use distance, buffered zones, and GeoJSON conversion to power the map and operational tables without moving the data into a separate GIS platform. 

The Oracle Internals sidebar shows the SQL evidence behind the page, including `SDO_GEOM.SDO_DISTANCE`, `SDO_BUFFER`, `SDO_UTIL.TO_GEOJSON`, and the VPD policy that controls fulfillment-center visibility.

Access controls help ensure users see only the data they are allowed to see, which matters for regional order access, customer data, and governed AI use.

### Objectives

In this scene, you will learn what retail decision the page supports, what evidence the user should inspect, and what action the business may take next.

## Task 1: Review the fulfillment network context

Review the fulfillment network to understand where demand can be served without increasing delivery cost, delay, or inventory risk.

1. Click **Intelligent Fulfillment Network** in the sidebar.
2. Review the KPI tiles at the top of the page. They summarize active fulfillment centers, total inventory, pending shipments, and inventory alerts.
3. Review the VPD banner below the tiles. It shows which demo user is active and whether the page is using full access or a region-filtered fulfillment view.
4. Review the map workspace. This is where fulfillment centers, service zones, customer geography, routes, density, and demand regions can be layered together.

In the current demo dataset, the page shows **30** active centers, about **495.7K** units of inventory, **750** pending shipments, and a live set of inventory alerts. Use those numbers to set the operational scene: this is not a single warehouse decision, but a network decision across inventory, geography, and active demand.

## Task 2: Explore spatial demand and service coverage

Explore spatial demand and service coverage to see how customer location affects shipping speed, fulfillment cost, center workload, and the customer promise.

1. In **Map Layers**, turn on **Service Zones** and **Demand Regions** if they are not already active.
2. Review the dashed service-zone rings around fulfillment locations. These show how delivery coverage changes by service tier.
3. Review the demand-region polygons. The demand index color scale helps identify regions where demand pressure is higher.
4. Open the collapsed **Oracle Internals** sidebar if you want to inspect the spatial SQL behind the map.

Use the map to explain how the same database can serve operational and spatial questions. Fulfillment teams can look at inventory centers and service coverage together with regional demand signals. The Oracle Internals sidebar connects the visual layer back to Oracle Spatial functions such as `SDO_BUFFER` for zones and `SDO_UTIL.TO_GEOJSON` for rendering demand-region polygons in the browser.

## Task 3: Inspect fulfillment-center load

Inspect fulfillment-center load to identify centers that may be overloaded or underused. This helps the retailer consider routing changes, rebalancing, or replenishment.

1. Scroll to **Fulfillment Centers**.
2. Review the center name, location, type, products stocked, total inventory, pending shipments, and load percentage.
3. Focus on **Charlotte Southeast** as one example. In the current dataset, it carries **77** stocked products, about **20.1K** inventory units, **22** pending shipments, and **20.1%** load.
4. Compare this row with other centers to understand where there may be available capacity or regional pressure.

This table helps the user move from a map-level network view to a center-level operating view. A fulfillment manager can see which centers have inventory depth, where shipment activity is already queued, and whether load levels leave room to absorb demand.

## Task 4: Investigate an inventory alert

Investigate inventory alerts to decide whether the business should replenish stock, rebalance inventory, adjust promotions, or protect units for higher-priority demand.

1. Scroll to **Inventory Alerts - Social Demand Surge**.
2. Review the top alert rows. Red rows indicate products with a demand signal, while yellow rows indicate low-stock items without the same projected demand pressure.
3. Focus on **Summit Graphic Training Tee** at **Portland Pacific**.
4. Interpret the row: **23** units are in stock, predicted demand is **104** units, and the social demand factor is **1.6x**.

This is the data point to emphasize during the demo. The story is that a sporting-goods apparel product is receiving amplified demand signals while one fulfillment center has limited available stock. The operational response could be to replenish Portland Pacific, reroute fulfillment from another center, adjust promotion timing, or alert the merchandising team before the shortage becomes visible to customers.

Retail teams can see which products, brands, and locations need attention before availability or fulfillment suffers. Oracle AI Database supports this by combining inventory, fulfillment center, forecast, spatial coverage, center load, and social signal data in one governed data platform, then presenting the alert in the same operational interface.

You can move to the next scene.
