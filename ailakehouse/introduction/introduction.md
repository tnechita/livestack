# PeakGear AI Lakehouse LiveStack Guide

## Introduction

Estimated Workshop Time: TODO - x minutes


**PeakGear Sporting Goods** is the fictional retail business used throughout this LiveStack. The webshop, fulfillment sites, product catalog, demand signals, and AI experiences in this guide all belong to that same demo business scenario.

PeakGear faces a familiar retail problem: demand shifts faster than operations can respond. A product can go viral overnight through social channels or supplier activity, but the business still must coordinate inventory, fulfillment capacity, routing, customer demand, returns risk, and catalog data before it can act.

Without a single governed platform, teams face slow decisions, stockouts, duplicate pipelines, synchronization delays, and AI responses disconnected from live business data.

By the end of this LiveStack demo, you will understand the basic **AI Lakehouse** flow: data enters the platform, the data is prepared into trusted products, and those trusted products power dashboards, search, predictions, and agents for PeakGear.

Estimated Demo Time: **150 minutes**

Each scene is designed to take between **5 and 10 minutes**.

### Objectives

In this LiveStack Demo, you will see how PeakGear can:

* Reduce stockouts
* Improve product discovery
* Lower fulfillment costs
* Reduce returns risk
* Accelerate business decision-making
* Enable trusted AI automation

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, confirm that you can open the running PeakGear Sporting Goods LiveStack in a modern browser. No coding or database administration knowledge is required to follow the business workflow.

## Architecture of PeakFlow

PeakFlow is the source-to-outcome architecture used by the PeakGear demo. Think of it as the map for the LiveStack: it shows where the data starts, how the data is prepared, and which business experiences use the prepared data.

The flow starts with source data such as product master data, orders, customer records, inventory snapshots, product images, demand signals, fulfillment sites, and returns activity. The demo shows several ways that data can enter the lakehouse:

- **Streaming ingest** for demand signals through **Kafka** and **GoldenGate Stream Analytics**.
- **Change data capture** from a NetSuite-style operational database through GoldenGate Studio.
- **Batch and object-storage loading** for product master, POS order, inventory, and product image manifest files through Data Studio.

The core **AI Lakehouse** process is the medallion flow from **Bronze** to **Silver** to **Gold**. Bronze preserves raw, source-shaped data. Silver cleans, standardizes, and enriches that data. Gold publishes curated data products that are ready for dashboards, applications, AI features, and business decisions.

Catalog makes those trusted assets discoverable and understandable before they are reused. Users can find a curated table, understand its columns and business meaning, and publish a reusable view that becomes another data product.

The business outcomes in later scenes come from curated products. Serve Data shows business users trusted data products through dashboards and app pages. Serve AI shows AI experiences built on those same trusted products.
