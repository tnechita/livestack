# Scene 5 Batch and File Loading Ingest

## Introduction

**PeakGear** does not only depend on live event streams. Streaming handles data that arrives continuously, while batch loading handles files that arrive as a set, such as product master updates or inventory snapshots.

Without a governed file loading path, these files often turn into manual spreadsheet work, one-off scripts, or direct updates into reporting tables. That creates familiar retail problems: product descriptions drift from the webshop, inventory teams argue over which snapshot is current, planners cannot explain why an order total changed, and AI experiences are grounded in data that no one can trace back to the original source file.

This scene shows how PeakGear lands batch files into the Bronze layer before anything is cleaned or reshaped. **Bronze** is intentionally not polished yet; it preserves the original file shape so the source remains traceable.

In this walkthrough, you will load `product_master_raw.csv` as the worked example. It is a good retail batch file because it contains the catalog attributes PeakGear needs before products can be searched, recommended, priced, joined to inventory, and used in curated data products.

Demand signals are not loaded in this scene. They are covered by the Real-Time Streaming Ingest scene.

Estimated Time: **10 minutes**

### Objectives

In this scene, you will:

- Open the **Batch & File Loading** demo from the **Ingest** menu.
- Review the Data Studio access point from the LiveStack page.
- Start a Data Load flow in Oracle Database Actions.
- Use the Object Storage public URL flow to locate the Bronze source files.
- Load `product_master_raw.csv` into a Bronze table.
- Verify that the loaded product master file contains the expected row count.
- Connect file-based Bronze ingest to later Silver and Gold business outcomes.

## Task 1: Open the Batch & File Loading demo

1. In the left sidebar, expand **Ingest**.
2. Select **Batch & File Loading (Data Studio)**.
3. Confirm that the page title is **Batch & File Loading (Data Studio)** before continuing.

## Task 2: Open Data Studio from the LiveStack page

![LiveStack page showing the Open Data Studio action](images/task-2-open-data-studio.png)

Perform the following set of steps to open **Data Studio** from the LiveStack page:

1. Click **Open Data Studio**.
2. Sign in to Database Actions with the displayed PG username and password.
3. Return to the LiveStack page if you need to copy the Object Storage URL later in the walkthrough.

## Task 3: Choose Data Load in Database Actions

![Database Actions Data Studio page showing the Load Data tile](images/task-3-choose-data-load.png)

Perform the following set of steps to choose **Data Load** in **Database Actions**:

1. In Database Actions, open **Data Studio**.
2. Select **Data Load**.
3. Click the **Load Data** tile to start a new loading job.

## Task 4: Enter the Object Storage public URL

![Data Load page showing Cloud Store and public URL field](images/task-4-enter-object-storage-url.png)

Perform the following set of steps to enter the **Object Storage** public URL:

1. Select **Cloud Store**.
2. Copy the Object Storage prefix from the LiveStack page.
3. Paste it into the public URL field.
4. Press **Enter** to list the available Bronze files.
5. The **No Credential Found** banner is expected for this public URL flow.

## Task 5: Select the product master CSV

![Cloud Store file list showing product_master_raw.csv](images/task-5-select-product-master-file.png)

Perform the following set of steps to select the product master CSV for this walkthrough:

1. In the Cloud Store file list, locate `product_master_raw.csv`.
2. Select only `product_master_raw.csv` for this walkthrough.

The batch file set used by this scene is:

| Source file                       | Bronze target table           | Expected rows |
| -----------------------------------| -------------------------------| --------------:|
| `product_master_raw.csv`          | `PRODUCT_MASTER_RAW`          | 38            |
| `orders_pos_raw.csv`              | `ORDERS_POS_RAW`              | 59            |
| `inventory_snapshot_raw.csv`      | `INVENTORY_SNAPSHOT_RAW`      | 42            |
| `product_images_manifest_raw.csv` | `PRODUCT_IMAGES_MANIFEST_RAW` | 37            |

## Task 6: Add the file and review settings

![Data Load job showing product_master_raw.csv and Review Settings](images/task-6-add-file-review-settings.png)

Perform the following set of steps to add the file and review load settings:

1. Double-click `product_master_raw.csv`, or drag it into the loading job panel.
2. Confirm that the job card shows `product_master_raw.csv`.
3. Click **Review Settings**.

## Task 7: Confirm the Bronze table name and CSV header

![Review Settings dialog showing PRODUCT_MASTER_RAW and header row settings](images/task-7-review-target-table.png)

Perform the following set of steps to confirm the Bronze table name and CSV header settings:

1. Confirm that **Table Name** is `PRODUCT_MASTER_RAW`.
2. Confirm that **Column header row** is checked.
3. Confirm that the field delimiter is **Comma**.
4. If `PRODUCT_MASTER_RAW` already exists in your environment and you do not want to replace it, use a temporary table name such as `PRODUCT_MASTER_RAW_DEMO` for the loading exercise.

## Task 8: Preview the product master file

![Preview dialog showing rows from product_master_raw.csv](images/task-8-preview-product-master-file.png)

Perform the following set of steps to preview the product master file before loading it:

1. Select **Preview**.
2. Confirm that the preview shows product fields such as source system, SKU, product name, brand, category, price, and launch date.
3. Close the settings dialog after the preview and table settings look correct.

## Task 9: Start the load

![Data Load job showing the Start button for product_master_raw.csv](images/task-9-start-load.png)

Perform the following set of steps to start the file load:

1. Confirm that the job card still shows `product_master_raw.csv`.
2. Click **Start**.
3. Wait for Database Actions to finish the load.
4. If you used a temporary table name in Task 7, remember that name for the verification query.

## Task 10: Verify the loaded Bronze table

![Database Actions Launchpad showing SQL Worksheet](images/task-10-open-sql-worksheet.png)

Perform the following set of steps to verify the loaded **Bronze** table:

1. Return to the Database Actions Launchpad.
2. Open **Development**.
3. Select **SQL**.
4. Click **Open**.
5. Run the row-count query for the table you loaded.

    ```sql
    SELECT COUNT(*) AS product_master_rows
    FROM PRODUCT_MASTER_RAW;
    ```

If you used a temporary table name, replace `PRODUCT_MASTER_RAW` with that table name:

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) AS product_master_rows
FROM PRODUCT_MASTER_RAW_DEMO;
```

The expected row count for `product_master_raw.csv` is **38**.

## Conclusion: Business Outcome

Batch and file loading gives PeakGear a controlled way to bring source files into the AI Lakehouse. The product master CSV is not the final business product; it is the Bronze starting point that preserves the file as it arrived.

Once the file is in Bronze, the medallion process can make it reusable. Silver processing can standardize categories, validate prices, deduplicate SKUs, enrich product attributes, and connect image metadata. Gold data products can then serve a governed catalog foundation to webshop search, product discovery, operations dashboards, fulfillment decisions, and AI agents.

For PeakGear, this means file-based source data becomes part of the same trusted lakehouse flow as streaming and CDC data. The business avoids one-off file handling and gains a repeatable path from raw product data to operational outcomes.

You can move to the next scene.
