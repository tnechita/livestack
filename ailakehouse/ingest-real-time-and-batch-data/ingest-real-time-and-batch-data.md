# Scene 3 Real-Time Streaming Ingest

## Introduction

**PeakGear** sells in a market where demand can change before traditional reporting catches up. Real-time streaming lets the demo capture demand signals as they happen instead of waiting for a later batch report.

Without real-time streaming, PeakGear risks reacting too late. In this scene, the Bronze layer receives the raw live demand events first, so later processing can clean and enrich them before they become business-ready signals.

This scene shows how PeakGear can move from delayed awareness to live business sensing. By capturing demand signals as they happen, the business creates an early-warning system for planners, merchandisers, fulfillment teams, and customer-facing AI. Those signals become the starting point for later processing, where raw observations are refined into trusted data products that support demand sensing, product discovery, dashboards, predictions, and AI agents.

Estimated Time: **10 minutes**

### Objectives

In this scene, you will:

- Open the **Real-Time Streaming** demo from the **Ingest** menu.
- Review where GoldenGate Stream Analytics access and readiness status are shown.
- Confirm the Kafka, ADB connection, and Bronze target values used by the stream.
- Start the live demand-signal generator.
- Monitor events as they land in the Bronze layer.
- Connect Bronze streaming ingest to later Silver and Gold data products.

## Task 1: Open the Real-Time Streaming demo

Perform the following set of steps to open the Real-Time Streaming demo:

1. In the left sidebar, expand **Ingest**.
2. Select **Real-Time Streaming**.
3. Confirm that the page title is **Real-Time Streaming** before continuing.

## Task 2: Review GoldenGate Stream Analytics access

Perform the following set of steps to review GoldenGate Stream Analytics access without changing the prepared pipeline:

1. Click **Open OSA** if you want to inspect GoldenGate Stream Analytics in a new tab.
2. Use the displayed OSA credentials to sign in when prompted.
3. In GoldenGate Stream Analytics, review the existing streaming pipeline only. Do not create or change the pipeline during this demo walkthrough.
4. On the LiveStack page, confirm that **GoldenGate Stream Analytics** is **Ready** and that the **AI Lakehouse Bronze Target** is reachable.

## Task 3: Confirm the Kafka-to-Bronze pipeline values

![OSA Pipeline Inputs showing Kafka topic and Bronze target table](images/task-3-pipeline-inputs.png)

Perform the following set of steps to confirm the Kafka-to-Bronze pipeline values:

1. Review **OSA Pipeline Inputs**.
2. Confirm the Kafka bootstrap value and the Kafka topic **peakgear.demand.signals.raw**.
3. Confirm the ADB connection **PeakGear_ADB**.
4. Confirm the target table **PG.BRONZE\_DEMAND\_SIGNALS**.
5. Select **OSA pipeline has been created** after you have confirmed the pipeline exists in GoldenGate Stream Analytics. This enables the generator controls in the LiveStack page.

## Task 4: Start the live demand-signal stream

![Generator Control section showing Prepare Topic and Start Stream](images/task-4-start-stream.png)

Perform the following set of steps to start the live demand-signal stream and watch events reach Bronze:

1. Click **Prepare Topic** to confirm that the Kafka topic is available.
2. Click **Start Stream**.
3. Let the stream run long enough to produce visible events.
4. Watch **Events Produced** and **Lakehouse Rows** increase. Matching counts show that generated events are reaching the Bronze table.
5. Click **Stop** when you have enough events for the walkthrough.

## Task 5: Monitor Bronze events

![Recent Demand Signals section showing live events landed through the streaming path](images/task-5-monitor-bronze-events.png)

Perform the following set of steps to monitor recent Bronze demand events:

1. Review **Recent Demand Signals**.
2. Point out that each **LIVE-** event came from the generator, moved through Kafka, was processed by GoldenGate Stream Analytics, and landed in **PG.BRONZE\_DEMAND\_SIGNALS**.
3. Explain that Bronze is intentionally raw. The next processing stage can clean, validate, deduplicate, enrich, and match products before Silver and Gold outputs are created.
4. Use **Clear Live Rows** only when you need to reset this scene for a clean replay.

## Conclusion: Business Outcome

Real-time streaming gives PeakGear earlier awareness of demand changes. Instead of waiting for delayed reports, planners and operations teams can see live demand signals land in the Bronze layer as they happen.

The value is not only the stream itself. The stream becomes part of the AI Lakehouse medallion process: Bronze preserves the source-shaped event, Silver can standardize and enrich it, and Gold can serve demand-aware data products to dashboards, fulfillment planning, predictions, and AI agents.

For PeakGear, this means the business can detect product demand sooner, react before inventory pressure becomes a customer problem, and ground downstream operational decisions in live governed data.

You can move to the next scene.
