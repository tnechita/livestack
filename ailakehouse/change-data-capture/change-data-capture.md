# Scene 4 Change Data Capture Ingest

## Introduction

PeakGear's customer data does not begin in the **Lakehouse**. Change data capture, or CDC, copies changes from an operational system into the Lakehouse as those changes happen.

Without change data capture, those updates reach analytics, applications, and AI experiences too late. A newly upgraded loyalty customer might still be treated like a standard shopper. A service agent might see an old email address. A dashboard might miss the newest customers until the next batch load finishes. The business outcome is familiar: decisions are technically correct for yesterday, but not current enough for the moment PeakGear needs to act.

This scene shows how PeakGear closes that gap. You are not building CDC from scratch; you are reviewing and running a prepared CDC flow so you can understand how the LiveStack keeps operational changes moving into the lakehouse.

Estimated Time: **10 minutes**

### Objectives

In this scene, you will:

- Open the **Change Data Capture** demo from the **Ingest** menu.
- Review the GoldenGate Studio access point and CDC readiness status.
- Confirm the source customer table, Bronze mirror table, extract, and replicat values.
- Start the prepared CDC pipeline in GoldenGate Studio.
- Insert a customer change in the NetSuite-style source system.
- Verify that the change appears in the Bronze customer mirror.
- Connect CDC ingest to the later Bronze, Silver, and Gold data product flow.

## Task 1: Open the Change Data Capture demo

![Sidebar navigation showing Ingest and Change Data Capture](images/task-1-open-change-data-capture.png)

Perform the following set of steps to open the **Change Data Capture** demo:

1. In the left sidebar, expand **Ingest**.
2. Select **Change Data Capture (GoldenGate Studio)**.
3. Confirm that the page title is **Change Data Capture** before continuing.

## Task 2: Review GoldenGate access and CDC readiness

![Change Data Capture page showing GoldenGate access and CDC readiness cards](images/task-2-goldengate-access-and-readiness.png)

Perform the following set of steps to review GoldenGate access and CDC readiness:

1. Review the **GoldenGate Studio** login area.
2. Click **Open GoldenGate** to open GoldenGate Studio in a new browser tab.
3. Use the displayed username and password from your environment to sign in.
4. Return to the LiveStack page and confirm that **NetSuite Source DB**, **Oracle GoldenGate Studio Free**, and **ADB Bronze Customer Mirror** show **Ready**.
5. If **CDC Flow** is still **Pending**, continue to the next tasks. That means the prepared pipeline still needs to be started.

## Task 3: Review the source-to-Bronze CDC configuration

![LiveStack CDC configuration showing source and Bronze target values](images/task-3-review-cdc-configuration.png)

Perform the following set of steps to review the source-to-Bronze CDC configuration:

1. Review **GoldenGate Studio CDC Configuration**.
2. Confirm the source table **NETSUITE.CUSTOMERS**.
3. Confirm the Bronze target table **PG.BRONZE\_NETSUITE\_CUSTOMERS**.
4. Confirm that an **Extract** and **Replicat** are listed.
5. Review the row counts and baseline status. Matching source and Bronze counts show that the initial customer baseline is synchronized before live changes are captured.

## Task 4: Start the prepared CDC pipeline in GoldenGate Studio

Perform the following set of steps to start the prepared CDC pipeline in GoldenGate Studio:

![GoldenGate Studio Pipelines page showing the prepared CDC pipeline](images/task-4-goldengate-pipeline-list.png)

1. Select **Open GoldenGate**
2. In **GoldenGate Studio**, select **Pipelines**.
2. Open the prepared pipeline **PeakGear\_NetSuite\_Customers\_CDC**.
3. Do not click **Create Pipeline**. The CDC pipeline already exists for this demo.

    ![GoldenGate Studio pipeline details showing the Start button](images/task-4-start-cdc-pipeline.png)

1. On the pipeline details page, review the pipeline name and deployment.
2. Click **Start**.
3. Wait for GoldenGate Studio to start the CDC runtime.
4. Return to the LiveStack page and wait for **CDC Flow** to change from **Pending** to **Ready**.

If the pipeline is already running, **Start** may be disabled and **Stop** may be enabled. In that case, leave the pipeline running and continue.

![GoldenGate Studio Pipelines page showing the CDC pipeline running](images/task-4-pipeline-running-list.png)

After the pipeline starts, the **Pipelines** page shows **PeakGear\_NetSuite\_Customers\_CDC** with status **RUNNING**.

![GoldenGate Studio runtime view showing Extract and Replicat running](images/task-4-pipeline-running-runtime.png)

In the pipeline details page, the **Runtime** view shows the running Extract and Replicat processes. This is the best GoldenGate Studio view to explain that the prepared CDC pipeline is active. The total operations and last-operation values can differ between demo runs.

## Task 5: Insert a customer change

![LiveStack source change panel showing CDC Flow ready and Insert Customer enabled](images/task-5-insert-customer-change.png)

Perform the following set of steps to insert a customer change into the source system:

1. In the LiveStack page, locate **Simulate Customer Changes**.
2. If the warning says to start the GoldenGate Studio pipeline, return to Task 4 and start the pipeline.
3. After **CDC Flow** is **Ready**, click **Insert Customer**.
4. Wait for the page to refresh. The inserted customer represents a new operational change created in the NetSuite-style source system.
5. Use **Clear Demo Rows** only when you need to reset the CDC scenario for a clean replay.

## Task 6: Verify the Bronze customer mirror

![LiveStack comparison of NetSuite source customers and Bronze mirror customers](images/task-6-verify-bronze-mirror.png)

Perform the following set of steps to verify that the Bronze customer mirror received the source change:

1. Review the **NETSUITE.CUSTOMERS** source table.
2. Review the **PG.BRONZE\_NETSUITE\_CUSTOMERS** Bronze mirror.
3. Confirm that the inserted customer appears in both the source table and the Bronze mirror.
4. Confirm that the source and Bronze row counts increased together. The screenshot shows one completed run where both counts moved to **26** after the insert; your count can differ if the demo has been reset or replayed.

**Note:** Sample values may change after data refreshes or rebuilds. Focus on the expected result pattern and the business takeaway, not the exact values.

## Conclusion: Business Outcome

Change data capture helps PeakGear keep operational customer context current. When a customer record changes in the NetSuite-style source system, GoldenGate mirrors that change into the AI Lakehouse Bronze layer without waiting for a batch cycle.

That current customer data can then move through the medallion process. Bronze preserves the source-shaped change, Silver can standardize and validate it, and Gold can serve trusted customer context to dashboards, webshop personalization, customer analytics, predictions, and AI agents.

For PeakGear, this reduces the gap between what happened in the operational system and what the business can act on. Teams can make decisions from current customer data instead of reconciling stale extracts across disconnected tools.

You can move to the next scene.
