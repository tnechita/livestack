# Scene 16 Ask Your Data

## Introduction

PeakGear business users often need answers faster than a reporting backlog can deliver them. A merchandising lead may ask which categories drive revenue, an operations manager may ask where inventory is concentrated, and an executive may ask how demand signals are changing. Without a governed AI Lakehouse foundation, these questions often become spreadsheet pulls, manual SQL requests, or dashboard change tickets.

**Ask Your Data** shows a different Serve AI outcome. This is not a general chatbot; it is a natural-language interface over curated data with SQL that can be inspected.

The business outcome is faster decision-making with transparency. That transparency matters because users can review the generated SQL before trusting the answer.

Estimated Time: **10 minutes**

### Objectives

In this scene, you will:

- Open **Ask Your Data** from the **Serve AI** menu.
- Review the active Oracle Select AI runtime.
- Ask a revenue question in plain English.
- Inspect the generated SQL behind the answer.
- Connect natural-language data access to Gold-layer governed data.

## Task 1: Open Ask Your Data

Perform the following set of steps to open Ask Your Data:

1. In the left sidebar, expand **Serve AI**.
2. Select **Ask Your Data**.
3. Confirm that the page title is **Ask Your Data**.

This page is a Serve AI experience. The user is not preparing data or writing a pipeline. They are asking questions against curated data that has already been ingested, standardized, and served through the AI Lakehouse process.

## Task 2: Review the runtime and question options

Perform the following set of steps to review the runtime and question options:

1. Confirm that the runtime profile shows **Oracle Select AI**.
2. Review the available modes: **Narrate**, **Chat**, **Show SQL**, and **Run SQL**.
3. Keep **Narrate** selected for the first question.
4. Review the example question tiles.

The mode controls are useful during a technical verification. They show that the same governed data can support different consumption patterns: a narrated business answer, a conversational answer, a generated SQL preview, or executed SQL results.

## Task 3: Ask a revenue question and inspect SQL

Perform the following set of steps to ask a revenue question and inspect the generated SQL:

1. Select the example question:

    ```text
    What are the top 5 product categories by revenue?
    ```

2. Wait for the Select AI response.
3. Expand **View generated SQL**.
4. Review the answer and the SQL statement.

This step is important because it keeps the AI interaction auditable. The user can see the natural-language answer, but can also inspect the query that Oracle generated and ran against PeakGear's governed schema.

## Conclusion: Business Outcome

Ask Your Data shows how PeakGear can make Gold-layer data easier to consume without hiding how the answer is produced. The medallion process prepares trusted product, order, revenue, customer, inventory, and signal data. Oracle Select AI then helps business users translate questions into SQL over that governed foundation.

For the business, this reduces the time between question and answer, lowers dependence on one-off reporting requests, and gives users a transparent path from plain English to database-backed evidence.

You can move to the next scene.
